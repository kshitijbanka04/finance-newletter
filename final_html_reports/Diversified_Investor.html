            </li>
            <li>

                effective January 11, 2025. While his departure may create a temporary gap, ICICI Bank is encouraged to proactively manage succession planning

                The expansion into new markets and investment in technological advancements present lucrative prospects. 
                Existing shareholders are advised to <strong>Hold</strong>, benefiting from strategic momentum unless adverse litigation outcomes arise.
