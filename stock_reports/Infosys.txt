Port Hope Municipal hall is now Derry Public Library, The Port Hope Tourism Centre is now a City of Derry office, Ganaraska Financial is now Montgomery Financial, Gould\'s Shoes store front on Walton Street changed to a butcher shop, The Avanti Hair Design store front changed to Tony\'s Barber Shop, an empty storefront at 36 Walton Street changed to Reliance Cleaners, Queen Street Tattoo store front changed to Derry Scoop, a statue of Paul Bunyan was erected in Memorial Park, US flags now hang in place of Canadian flags downtown, and Port Hope Capitol Theatre had appeared to be showing Batman (1989) and Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), thus confirming the film\'s setting of 1989.[181][182]\nOn July 11, 2016, preliminary shooting took place in Port Hope Town Hall, Memorial Park cenotaph, Queen Street between Walton and Robertson streets and the Capitol Theatre.[183] The film broke the record for the highest Monday that the month of September has ever seen with $8.8\xa0million (besting The Sixth Sense\'s (1999) $6.37\xa0million),[376] the biggest Monday ever for an R-rated horror and/or scary movie,[377] while breaking the record\nfor the highest Tuesday that the month of September has ever seen with $11.4\xa0million (besting Sully\'s $4.8\xa0million),[378] the highest Tuesday for a horror film (besting The Conjuring\'s $5.6\xa0million),[379] and the second-biggest single Tuesday for an R-rated horror film (behind The Omen\'s (2006) $12.6\xa0million).[380] The film went on to bring in $7.9\xa0million to attain the biggest Wednesday in September history and the biggest Wednesday for an R-rated horror movie,[380][381] while becoming the record holder for any horror film on a Thursday in September with $7.2\xa0million.[382]\nThe film became the highest-grossing Stephen King horror film ever in North America and worldwide, even adjusted for inflation (besting The Shining\'s (1980) $145\xa0million).[383] A few days before It\'s release, Shawn Robbins and Alex Edghill increased the estimated projection from $70\xa0million to $81\xa0million on in its opening weekend,[413] with a statement later suggesting the forecast of $81\xa0million to potentially be low.[414]\nReports in August 2017 from Forbes\'s Scott Mendelson predicted the film may enter the record books for the horror movie genre, with a realistic prediction of It opening over or under of The Conjuring (2013) and The Conjuring 2\'s (2016) $40\xa0million opening weekend,[415][416] though Mendelson stated that Fifty Shades Darker\'s (2017) $46.6\xa0million opening, and $114.4\xa0million domestic finish may just be at the lower end of expectations.[2] Mendelson later stated that while It will break the record for biggest opening weekend for a non-sequel R-rated horror movie, held by The Conjuring (2013) at $41.8\xa0million,[417][418] it may snag one of the biggest gaps between first newbie and second place newbie ever, a record is held by the opening weekends of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and Alice in Wonderland (2010),[419] with him concluding "It\'s not beyond the mountains of madness that It could snag $77m all by itself. Paré spoke of the special attention paid to the water drainage for the sewer, as well as the water marks that he said echoed those of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.[223]\nParé later explained that his team looked at the location, with them later having kids climb up and down to which later resulted in the construction of the well on the stage, which connects Pennywise\'s tunnel, giving access to the tunnels, which in turn gives access to the cistern:[217] "which is the giant set that we\'re shooting now, and in which Pennywise has his wagon and on top of which there\'s a pile of all the clothes and toys of the dead kids over the many centuries."[217', 'score': 0.6108487, 'raw_content': None}, {'title': 'It (2017) - Rotten Tomatoes', 'url': 'https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/it_2017', 'content': "Genre:\nHorror,\nMystery & thriller\nOriginal Language:\nEnglish\nDirector:\nAndy Muschietti\nProducer:\nRoy Lee,\nDan Lin,\nSeth Grahame-Smith,\nDavid Katzenberg,\nBarbara Muschietti\nWriter:\nChase Palmer,\nCary Joji Fukunaga,\nGary Dauberman\nRelease Date (Theaters):\nSep 8, 2017\nwide\nRelease Date (Streaming):\nDec 19, 2017\nBox Office (Gross USA):\n$327.5M\nRuntime:\n2h 15m\nDistributor:\nWarner Bros.
