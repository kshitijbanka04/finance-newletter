Commerce (ICC) laid out a road map for digital trade in financial services in 2020, and the UN Commission on International Trade is leading a new Model Law on Electronic Records (MLETR) to recognize the legal validity of electronic trade records.160 Taking inspiration, the United Kingdom became the first G7 country to sign the Electronic Trade Documents Act into law in July 2023, which recognizes electronic documents as the same legal outcome as paper documents.161 The new regulation is expected to be a big win for digital trade, not just in the country but globally.162\nBolstering revenue growth in asset servicing\nAsset servicing revenues have remained pressured in the first half of 2023, mimicking the constrained revenue growth in asset management in 2023.163 With many asset management clients expecting their assets under management (AUM) to decline or remain flat year over year, servicing revenues are not expected to deviate from this trend.\n European banks are ahead of their US competitors in the digital assets custody game, in part due to a proactive regulatory stance to bolster investor protection.165 In July 2023, Société Générale became the first bank to get a digital asset service provider license to operate as a crypto custodian and trading desk in France.166\nTransition to T+1 settlement in the United States, Canada, and Mexico by May 2024 will likely consume most of custodians’ operational bandwidth, as only about one-third of American and Canadian custodians in a Citibank survey were ready for T+1 transition.167 Custodians should participate in industrywide testing, which began in August 2023, to iron out system and process deficiencies.\n The immense processing power of quantum algorithms should make it possible for exchanges and market participants to perform tasks that were previously deemed too complicated, such as tasks in derivatives pricing,202 order matching,203 fraud detection and risk management,204 and portfolio optimization through natural language processing.205 A Deutsche Börse pilot, for example, found that quantum computing could reduce the time required for a business risk model simulation with 1,000 inputs from multiple years to less than 24 hours.206 While it may be a few years before this nascent technology can be applied to practical trading applications, some large financial institutions have started to work backward to identify problems that quantum technology may be best suited to solve.207\nUS banks and financial institutions are also exploring ways to maximize the value of data repositories they built for the SEC’s Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT), which became fully operational in 2023. More recently, India signed a deal with the UAE’s Mashreq Bank to use UPI to facilitate foreign remittances from the India diaspora in the region.82\nEurope also plans to create a unified instant payments solution with its European Payments Initiative, a new payment standard for European consumers and merchants for all types of transactions, including in-store, online, cash withdrawal, and peer-to-peer (P2P).83 Set to launch in Belgium, France, and Germany in 2024, this initiative aims to offer a pan-European bank card, digital wallet, and P2P payments solution to consumers for lower friction in cross-border payments.\n', 'score': 0.6466616, 'raw_content': None}, {'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelabbott/2024/01/16/the-top-10-banking-trends-for-2024--the-age-of-ai/', 'title': 'The Top 10 Banking Trends For 2024 – The Age Of AI - Forbes', 'content': "Samsung Prepares Stunning Free Offers For Every Galaxy S24 Pre-Order\nTrump Breezes To Victory In Iowa Caucuses Amid Lower Voter Turnout\nHere’s How The Iowa Caucuses Work—And What Time To Expect Results\nBanks are more likely to benefit from gen AI than any other industry, according to our analysis, with a potential productivity boost of 22-30%.\n More From Forbes\nThe Top 10 Banking Trends For 2024 – The Age Of AI\nGen AI won't change banking, but it will change how it gets done\nNow that we’re 25 years into the digital revolution in banking, we can say with confidence that it has not disappointed.
