Successful execution and integration will be key to realizing the expected benefits. If managed effectively, this move may enhance shareholder value, foster innovation, and position the company as a leader in its industry segment. However, vigilance in addressing the identified risks will be essential to safeguard against possible setbacks and ensure sustained growth momentum."]
